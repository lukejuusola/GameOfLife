Conway's Game of Life -- Another toy program

I like toys.



Finite automata are interesting in their own right. I recommend looking more into them if you're wholly unfamiliar. 

Currently, this program can randomly generate starting conditions, or you can input a text file. 

Future improvements may include:
  update to effectively infinite automata
  add GUI, so the output automata size isn't limited by the terminal window.
  add variable update rules in form "B123/S345"
